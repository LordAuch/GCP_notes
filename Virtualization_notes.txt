		VIRTUALIZATION KEYPOINTS:
===========================================================


* Types of virtualization:
	+ Full virtualization
		- Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM)
		- Emulates whole the computer: Mother board, RAM, etc...
		- Emulating CPU is slow, although some CPU allows to run instructions from VM directly in the CPU
		- Allows to install any OS
	+ Paravirtualization
		The OS knows its running virtulization

* QEMU+KVS
	+ Together allow to bring up virtual machines
	+ QEMU allows allows us to emulate hardware
	+ If possible, QEMU will use KVM to run instructions directly in the CPU
	+ KVS lets the instrucions pass from the VM to the processor

* Hypervisor 
	+ A piece of software, firmware ir hardware that creates and runs virtual machines
	+ a HOST is the machine that runs the hypervisor, GUEST machines are created by hypervisor
	+ Type 1 (Native or Bare metal):
		- Hypervisor act as the OS and craetes the virtual machines
		- Hypervisor doesn´t run on any OS.
	+ Type 2 (Hosted):
		- Hypervisor runs on an OS. In this case Hypervisor act as an application of the OS

* Troubleshooting:
	+ Unique IP and MAC Adress
		- Signal: Slow network performance
	+ Software Firewalls
		- Signal: Not allowed traffic. Check both host and guests!
	+ Host/Guests Network adapater
		- Signal: No host internet connection. Slow net performance (Adapter satured!)
		- Up to date drivers
