# PROCEDURES DESCRIPTION

### Recovery mode Ubuntu (Logging in as root)
Press `Shift` for few seconds after power up. (Works in VM as well).

### Booting Process
0. The MPU loads its firmware (Pre-Installed from manufactory)
	This firmware is a small program that reads the bootloader from a specific address. (MPU dependent)
1. Firmware loads the bootloader
	For embedded devices the bootloader is usually u-boot. 
	For robust systems like laptops, or servers it is usally GRUB.
2. The bootloader has information about where the kernel and device tree are located, it also passes boot arguments to the kernel.
3. Once the kernel startrs it mount the rootfs from the location specified (or passed) by the bootloader.
4. Kernel starts systemd (Porcess Control Daemon)


### Get into the GRUB shell
Press `Shift` for few seconds after power up to enter GRUB
To enter the GRUB console, once in GRUB press:
```
Crtl+C
```


### Analyzing partirions from GRUB
Once in GRUB console wirite `ls` to see all the disk mounted.
To get info about a partition we can use:
```
ls (<Disk>,<partitionName>)
        example: ls (hd0.msdos1)

```
To see the content of a partition:
```
ls (<Disk>,<partitionName>)/
	example: ls (hd0.msdos1)/
	We can navigate:
		ls (hd0.msdos1)/some/existing/dir
```
NOTE: `msdos` refers to a MBR partition while `GPT` refers to a GUID partition table. 


### Modifying GRUB bootloader (boot process) - TEMP
Press `Shift` for few seconds after power up.
Highlight "Ubuntu" and press key `e` to edit.
Two importants options here are:
1. linux
	The kernel that will be loaded and its configuration
2. initrd
	The initial ram disk.

For instance, to add the runlevel mode to boot with (One time), add the following after `ro` part in linux argument:
```
systemd.unit=<mode>
```
To make the changes persistent we need to modify 


### Modifying GRUB bootloader (boot process) - PERSISTENT
Modify the file `/etc/default/grub`. This file contains some configs for GRUB.
In order to apply the changes run
```
sudo update-grub
```

NOTE: Configuration files that specify which options are available in GRUB are located in
```
/etc/grub.d
```

### Updating kernel params in runtime - sysctl
This allows us to change some kernel parameters whitout having to recompile it.
This can be done with the command `sysctl` which allows us to change kernel params runtime.
We can see available options with:
```
sysctl -a
```
NOTE that is not the same `sysctl` and `systemctl`.
There are some options exposed aswell within `/proc/sys`, this allows us to change these params just by editing the file.
We can also write the param using `sysctl` in write mode:
```
sysctl -w <ParamName>=<Value>
```
NOTE: This is a temp change, if you cant to make this change persistent, edit `/etc/sysctl.conf`.
If you want to changes to be persistent following a modular approach, you can set the values in `/etc/sysctl.d/`.
Cnfig in this folder `syctl.d` is applied numaracally, so the files starting with 99 will be applied last overwriting is needed.

 
### Installing packages from source
In order to install packages from source we need to get the source code. There are multiple ways of doing this, for instance, clonning
a repository from github or dowloading the tarball.
We can clone using `git clone`, or dowload the tarball release with `wget` command. Once in the source folder will usually find a script called 
`configure`. This file will create the `Makefile` according to our environment.
Once the `Makefile` is created we can just run `make` command to build the package. In order to use the package we need to install it in our system using:
```
make install
```
This command moves all the necesary files to global folders like `/usr/bin` or `/usr/lib`.


### Cron
Cron allow us to schedule tasks. In order to understand how it works check the following links:
```
https://cron.help
https://crontab.guru
```

### Encrypt a partition
There are 2 tools that result useful for this puropose:
1. dm-crypt
2. LUKS
These tools are available through `cryptssetup` package.
NOTE: Before encrypting your partition make sure you backup your data. It will be erased during process.
To encrypt the partition:
```
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/<partition>
```
NOTE: Make sure you save your password without this is impossible to recover data.
Dm-Crypt sits between the actual storage and the virtual disk given by dm-crypt.
Give the virtual partition a format. First open the virtual disk
```
cryptsetup open /dev/<partition> <NameOfVirtualDisk>
```
Navigate to it. It is located at `/dev/mapper`, then:
```
mkfs.<format> /dev/mapper/<partition>
```
Finally just mount it. You will have to open and mount it everytime it´s closed.
When you´re done with it umount it and MAKE SURE you close it
```
cryptsetup close <NameOfVirtualDisk>
```


### Mount a filesystem
Create a folder for the partiton in `/mnt/`
```
mkdit /mnt/myDrive
```
Mount the partition into the folder you created previously
```
mount /dev/<partition> /mnt/myDrive
```
When you're done with it you can unmount it
```
umountnn /mnt/myDrive
```
Note: If its an encrypted disk make dure to clode it after umount.


### Autimatically mount a filesystem
We can tell the system to mount a fs when boot, to do this we use the file `/etc/fstab`.
An important option when adding removable filesystems is to add the option `nofail` in options to prevent errors if thereś no such disk.
NOTE: Its recomended to use the UUID name instead of the partion name of the disk as it may change.


### Configure a DHCP server
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol automatically assigns IP adresses and communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a client
Install `isc-dhcp-server` in host (server) machine
```
sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server
```
There are 2 files that we are mainly interested in:
1. /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
	We need to set here the interface where the service is listening
2. /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
	Here we set all the other options.

The DCHP service listens for broadcast messages so it needs to listen a network interface, not a particular network address
We listen to the ethernet interface `enp0s3`. If your server has more than one ethernet interface you need to determine which one you want the 
service to run on. You set have more than one 


### Systemd 
The system may run in different `runlevels`. Each runlevel requires a particular set of services to run.
To see what services a runlevel wants to run we can dive into:
```
/etc/systemd/system/<runlevel>.wants/
```
All services listed within `/etc/systemd/` are symlinks to `/lib/systemd/`.
When creating our own service we can place it in `/etc/systemd/system/` or `/etc/systemd/user/`


### Configure a SSH server and client
HOST
Install `openssh-server` in host:
```
sudo apt install openssh-server
```
The instalation automatically creates and starts to run the service.
Client will be able to connect to the server on port 22. 
Configuration of the ssh verver can be found in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

By default all users can login with their username and pswd, but we can manage it with:
```
AllowUsers <user1> <user2>
DenyUsers <user1> <user2>
AllowGroups <group>
DenyGroups <group>
```
If we modify the service we need to re-run it:
```
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

CLIENT
install the `openssh-client`:
```
sudo apt install openssh-client
```
To connect to hust simply run:
```
ssh <username>:<HOST_IP> 
```
We can modify `.ssh/config` to add hosts so we can conncet to them fatser.
